# ReliefSleeve
The following repository is a detailed description of a prototype submitted to CCNY's BMES 2024 BioDesign Hackathon.

# Automated and Manual Vibration Sleeve

This Arduino project implements an automated and manual vibration sleeve using an MPU6050 accelerometer sensor. The sleeve can detect user jerks or twitches, and based on the threshold set by the user, it activates vibration motors to provide feedback.

## Features

- Automatic vibration activation based on user jerks/twitches detected by the MPU6050 sensor.
- User-configurable threshold for automatic activation.
- Manual vibration activation through user input.

## Components Used for Prototype

- Arduino Nano
- MPU6050 accelerometer and gyroscope sensor
- Vibration motors
- Other necessary electronic components (resistors, capacitors, etc.)
- Power source (battery or external power supply)
- LED Switches

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine:
2. Make sure the circuit board is implemented correctly.
